# komkom
Idiosyncratic collection of tools &amp; resources for generating poetry, by [Uche Ogbuji](http://uche.ogbuji.net)


## Abeg, wetin be komkom?

komkom is a Nigerian Pidgin onomatopoeic word for metal containers, especially empty ones.

I really should have called this ngwongwoni, which is the IMO superior term my Dad prefers, but that's farl less common, and would be far trickier for non-Nigerians to remember.
